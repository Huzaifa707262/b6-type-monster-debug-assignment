        <h3 class="question">2. What is the difference between global scope and block scope? </h3>
        Ans:
        <p class="ans">
            Globsl scope: The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables
            and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program,
            any function or conditional state can access that variable.

        </p>
        <p class="ans">Block scope: Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the
            scope of the
            variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional
            statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly
            brackets {}.</p>

        <h3 class="question">3. How does javascript event loop work?</h3>
        Ans:
        <p class="ans"> Event loop works by making a request to some internal or external "event provider" (that
            generally blocks the request until an event has arrived), then calls the relevant event handler.
        </p>
